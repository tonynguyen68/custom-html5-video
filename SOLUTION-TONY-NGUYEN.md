# CUSTOM HTML5 VIDEO PLAYER

## My solution

I can create everything from the blank page (from zero), but I like this sentence: "You don't have to reinvent the wheel every day".

That is why after researching and looking for something on Google, I found a repository that has 40% of the goal.

It is using only HTML, CSS, and JS; native code only, no frameworks. The npm is only using the `browser-sync` package to support the developer to work faster.

I start by cloning that repository and then customize it.

I already change the author in package.json and README.md because I customized it.
